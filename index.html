                Soup is a primarily liquid food, generally served warm or hot (but may be cool or
                cold), that is made by combining ingredients of meat or vegetables with stock, or water. Hot soups are
                additionally characterized by boiling solid ingredients in liquids in a pot until the flavors are
                extracted, forming a broth. Soups are similar to stews, and in some cases there may not be a clear
                distinction between the two; however, soups generally have more liquid (broth) than stews.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-box">A salad is a dish consisting of pieces of food in a mixture, with at least one raw
                ingredient. It is often dressed, and is typically served at room temperature or chilled, though some
                (such as south German potato salad, or chicken salad) can be served warm.

                Garden salads use a base of leafy greens such as lettuce, arugula/rocket, kale or spinach; they are
                common enough that the word salad alone often refers specifically to garden salads. Other types include
                bean salad, tuna salad, fattoush, Greek salad (vegetable-based, but without leafy greens), and sōmen
                salad (a noodle-based salad). The sauce used to flavor a salad is generally called a salad dressing;
                most salad dressings are based on either a mixture of oil and vinegar or a fermented milk product like
                kefir.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-box">An entrée (/ˈɒ̃treɪ/, US also /ɒnˈtreɪ/; French: [ɑ̃tʁe]) in modern French table
                service and that of much of the English-speaking world (apart from the United States and parts of
                Canada) is a dish served before the main course of a meal. Outside North America, it is generally
                synonymous with the terms hors d'oeuvre, appetizer or starter. It may be the first dish served, or it
                may follow a soup or other small dish or dishes. In the United States and parts of Canada, the term
                entrée refers to the main dish or the only dish of the meal.</p>
